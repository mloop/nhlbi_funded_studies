# Purpose

When submitting a grant, we often want to know what successful grants look like. Looking through the NIH Reporter tool can be helpful when your query is specific, but understanding overall trends in types of projects funded can be difficult. Therefore, this repository provides an opportunity to look at 5,000 projects currently funded by NHLBI. There are lots of opportunities to perform analyses using data science and tidy text analyses.

# Limitations

* Only 5,000 records (of ~7,000) were downloaded, based upon restrictions in the NIH Reporter system
* Only *funded* grants are included, limiting our ability to make causal inferences about what would improve *your* grant. It's like if we were trying to study a disease using only case series. The information is helpful, but incomplete.
